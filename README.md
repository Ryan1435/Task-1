# CODSOFT
This repository contains the Python projects I developed during my internship at CodSoft in July 2025. The internship included three tasks designed to build hands-on experience in Python programming, GUI development, and logic-based applications.

These tasks helped me strengthen my skills in problem-solving, application structure, and user interaction through the use of Tkinter, random module, and other core Python libraries. Each project is structured to be simple, interactive, and beginner-friendly.

ðŸ”§ Tasks Completed:

Task 1 â€“ Simple Calculator
A GUI-based calculator built using Tkinter in Python. It performs basic arithmetic operations and includes a clear, responsive interface for user input.

Task 2 â€“ Password Generator
A random password generator created with Python that allows users to generate strong passwords of customizable lengths using letters, numbers, and special characters.

Task 3 â€“ Rock Paper Scissors Game
A Python-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game with a graphical user interface using Tkinter, where the user plays against the computer. It includes random choice logic, result display, and basic score tracking.
